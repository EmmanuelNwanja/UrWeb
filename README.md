# The Sad Part

In today's fast-paced digital world, education and career development have become increasingly important. However, access to quality education and opportunities for personal and communal growth is often limited, particularly for underserved populations. That's where UrWeb comes in.

You may have heard or read that more Africans are getting to use smartphones and a lot of them are youths. But nobody really talks about how internet subscription is managed and economized because of rising the cost of living.  We have platforms like YouTube with a vast content library but beyond having many options, when an African kid who's managing resources like an internet subscription wants to acquire knowledge or a new skill, they should have the means to find a means to easily locate their best bets.

This is not only beneficial to the underserved kid but to everyone looking to find their footing in the fast-paced Web3 ecosystem.

UrWeb is a platform that aims to reshape the landscape of Web3 education and career development by leveraging the power of people and blockchain technology. The platform provides access to community-quality educational resources, job listings, and growth tools, all in one place. But UrWeb is more than just a repository of information; it's a community-driven platform that empowers users to take control of their education and career paths while being guided by those before them.

How are we achieving this? Read on...
