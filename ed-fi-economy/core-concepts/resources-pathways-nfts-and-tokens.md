### Resource Quality Standards

UrWeb aims to provide **the most** **valuable** resources for growth to our users. Training programs, tutorials, basic descriptions and in-depth analysis will make up our primary content.&#x20;



### Pathways

Each resource on UrWeb will be labelled with one of our many pathways and up to **three** topics by its creator and the process will also be moderated by topic managers.
