# Pathway Voting

Unlike popular content distribution models, the UrWeb system utilizes a resource voting system which allows users and curators to influence which content becomes accepted and how they rank on the learning platform.

### Traditional System A: A Subscription Model, or "Twitter/RSS" Style&#x20;

Here, there is no centralized model as users select which content sources (distributors) to subscribe to. Creators can add content to different distributors and users can subscribe to different distributors. However, users may find it time-consuming to obtain information efficiently as they have to subscribe to each distributor individually. It can also be a lengthy process for new users to find clear paths for growth.

### Traditional System B: A Centralized Model using Machine Learning, or "YouTube" Style&#x20;

In these platforms, all uploaded content is parsed through a centralized model, which then uses machine learning to optimize the click-through rate of a piece of content. Content is shown to users that are most likely to interact with it, which serves the platform’s goal of keeping users’ attention, but also tends to bias users to only interact with content they want to see, creating so-called “information cocoons”. In these platforms, the models and data that power the centralized model are the core assets and are owned by the platform.

### UrWeb's solution&#x20;

UrWeb's solution **** is focused on enabling and promoting the best quality resources while giving power to the user to control what content ranks top. To do this, UrWeb will create sub-communities based on topics. Experienced users, those who hold Tier 2 Weber NFTs, of those sub-communities will become **curators** of the corresponding pathways. Curators can cast votes on **new content**; votes are not visible until the voting phase ends.

**Voting Powe**r: Users can **stake** $URWEB tokens to get voting power and to cast their votes.

**Content Score**: Content score is used to rank content within its sub-community, and is computed via the **Quadratic Voting Procedure** to prevent major token owners from dominating the ranking results.

**Voting Outcomes**: 10% of all learning rewards generated from a piece of resource will be shared by its voters, distributed by their voting power, 1% goes to the contributor who submitted the resource, and another 9% of total reward will go to the owner.

Reaching Nash Equilibrium as all parties tell their true understanding of the resource quality, UrWeb invariably improves the quality of knowledge served to its community.
