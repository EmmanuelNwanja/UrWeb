# Pathway Creation

The initial pathway list (\~10 paths) will be created by the UrWeb team and alpha contributors. New paths will be determined by UrWeb users following the pathway creation process below.



### **Path Creation Criteria**

* Users with Tier 3 NFTs can participate in the path-creation process.&#x20;
* Topics need to be within 50 characters.&#x20;
* The UrWeb team will select the initial topics, and a decentralized selection process will be implemented at a later stage.

### **Path Creation Process**

* A Tier 3 NFT user makes a topic-creation proposal by pre-ordering a certain number of NFTs with a potential new path.&#x20;
* Each user can pre-order up to 5 NFTs for a new path.&#x20;
* The pre-order price will be an average price of Tier 1 NFTs on the market.&#x20;
* Once a topic has 50 NFT pre-orders, it is officially created.&#x20;
* 50 NFTs will be minted and sent to users who participated in the pre-order.&#x20;
