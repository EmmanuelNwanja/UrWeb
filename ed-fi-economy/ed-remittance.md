# Ed-Remittance

To ease educational-related financial obligations and transactions locally and internationally, especially as regards the skill development and social impact contribution of Web3 enthusiasts, we will grow to include a DeFi feature that enables ease of cross-border and local study remittances with a bridge between fiat and crypto.

This is a big plan for our future at UrWeb. Users who have passed our proof of knowledge test(s) managed by the community and executed with AI will be automatically eligible for these scholarships as they fit their paths.&#x20;

Another use case will be in the areas of direct fee payment to institutions of learning using $--- tokens. This will enable the seamless processing of education-related fees, especially for international students from underserved regions.

Our token holders who have also passed the PoK or have guardians who have may be considered first in the case of scholarships or other token benefits.
