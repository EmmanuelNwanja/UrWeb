# Ed-Remittance

This is a giant plan for our future but UrWeb will enable the processing of scholarships for both local and international students through partnerships and our technology processes. Users who have passed our proof of knowledge test(s) managed by the community and executed with AI will be automatically eligible for these scholarships as they fit their paths.&#x20;

Another use case will be in the areas of direct fee payment to institutions of learning using $--- tokens. This will enable the seamless processing of education-related fees, especially for international students moving abroad from underserved regions.

Our token holders who have also passed the PoK or have guardians who have may be considered first in the case of scholarships or other token benefits.
