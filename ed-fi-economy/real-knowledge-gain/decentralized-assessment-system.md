# Decentralized Assessment System

UrWeb will enable the distribution of responsibility for evaluating and grading students across multiple nodes or participants, such as teachers, pathway experts, students, and peers, rather than being centrally controlled by a single entity.

We hope to leverage the power of blockchain technology to make education more accessible, affordable, and effective for everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location. By implementing a Decentralized Assessment System (DAS), our app will increase objectivity, enhance collaboration, improve feedback and impact, and provide flexibility in the skill development assessment process, thereby promoting a more inclusive and equitable educational experience for all.
