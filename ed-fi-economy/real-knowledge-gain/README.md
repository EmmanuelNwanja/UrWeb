# “Real” Knowledge Gain

$--- will be awarded based on the "real" proof of knowledge gained and contributions by users on UrWeb. The following behaviours will not count as "real" knowledge gained or contributions:

* No project completion
* Duplicate or copied projects
* No positive community contribution at all
* Unverified or community-approved resource/contribution

These will be updated as we discover new ways to make UrWeb better for everyone.
