# “Real” Knowledge Gain

$URWEB will be awarded based on the "real" proof of knowledge (PoK) gained and contributions by users on UrWeb. The following behaviours will not count as "real" knowledge gained or contributions:

* No project completion
* Duplicate or copied contributions
* No positive community contribution at all
* Unverified or community-approved resources/contributions/projects

_These will be updated as we discover new ways to make UrWeb better for everyone._
