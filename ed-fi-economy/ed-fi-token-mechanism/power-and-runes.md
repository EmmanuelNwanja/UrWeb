# Power and Runes

### Power System

Each Weber NFT has an energy capacity, which allows for runes to be socketed to the Catto. As a user gains RXP and levels up their NFTs, the energy capacity of the Weber will grow. Weber NFTs can only hold as many runes as their energy capacity allows for.

### Runes

#### **Rune Type and Generation**

There are three types of runes (Knight's Rune, Socerers's Run, and Queen's Rune) that boost static stats when socketed to a pair of Weber NFTs. Runes are generated as users read and differ in rarity, with rarer runes giving a higher stat boost.

#### **Rune Generation**

Runes are generated during the reading process.&#x20;

#### **Rune Upgrade Process**

Runes can also be combined and upgraded to the next rarity.
