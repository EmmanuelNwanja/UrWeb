# Levels, Tiers, and EXP

Each Weber NFT starts at level 0 and can be upgraded once the experience cap is met.

For each real-knoeledge gain when the user earns $URWEB, the equipped pair of Weber will gain 5 experience (RXP) points. When the daily reward cap has been reached, the user will stop earning RXP for that day.

When the experience cap is reached for a certain level, users can choose to upgrade the Weber NFT level at the cost of $URWEB tokens. The cost to upgrade is dependent on the current level of the Weber NFT.

Weber NFTs can be upgraded up to the level cap, which is different for each Tier.
