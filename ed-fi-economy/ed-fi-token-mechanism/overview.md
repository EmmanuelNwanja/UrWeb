To get started with on UrWeb's learn-to-earn, users will need to acquire and equip a Weber NFT, which will allow them to earn $URWEB tokens and ranking points (RXP). As they study, UrWeb will measure a user’s “real” knowledge gain and they will be awarded rewards based on their performance.&#x20;

There is an earning cap that limits the maximum $URWEB a user can earn daily. Users can increase the earning cap and earning speed by levelling up their Weber NFT with RXP, attaching runes to their Weber NFT, or acquiring more Weber NFTs with better stats, especially higher Tier Weber NFTs.&#x20;

Another important attribute is the Weber NFT’s Pathway. Whether the Pathway of the Weber NFT matches the resource/event the user is partaking in will greatly affect their earning speed. There are a limited number of Weber NFTs released for each pathway, after which, users will need to mint new NFTs to increase the amount of Weber NFTs for a given path ([`See Pathway Creation`](../goverance/pathway-creation.md)).&#x20;

As Weber NFTs are used, they begin to deteriorate and will eventually fall into a ‘sleep’ mode if not repaired. NFTs in sleep do not generate any rewards or RXP and may restrict users from participating fully in events. All Weber NFTs require $URWEB tokens for repair but Tier 2 and Tier 3 NFTs will also require certain community contributions to be repaired.
