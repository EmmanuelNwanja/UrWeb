# Minting New Weber

After the initial release, no new Weber NFTs of existing pathways will be released. To make more NFTs of existing pathways, users will need to mint them using Weber NFTs they already have in their inventory. To unlock minting, users will need two NFTs of at least Level 7 with the same path.&#x20;

* Two Weber of at least **level 7** to unlock minting.&#x20;
* These two NFTs need to have the same paths.

### Minting Cost and Pathway Inheritance

Each Weber NFT can be used to mint new NFTs a maximum of 6 times. The cost to mint a new Weber NFT and the probability of a new Weber NFT having the same path as the source NFT will increase the more times the existing Weber NFT is used for minting.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Mint Use</th><th>Cost (in $URWEB) </th><th>Source Path Inheritance Probability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>100</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>250</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>400</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>650</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>800</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1050</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>1200</td><td>0.8</td></tr></tbody></table>

If the two source Weber NFTs have differing mint counts, the cost and probability of inheritance will be an average of the two. If the new Weber NFT does not inherit the source path, a path randomly drawn from the existing pool will be chosen.

### Weber Chest

When a new Weber NFT is minted, it will appear as a Weber Chest, to be opened by the user or sold in the marketplace. Each Weber Box will have a tier attribute that is determined by the source Weber NFTs used to mint it.

| Source NFT A Tier | Source NFT B Tier | Weber Chest Tier 1 Prob | Weber Chest Tier 2 Prob | Weber Chest Tier 3 Prob |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Tier 1            | Tier 1            | 1                       | 0                       | 0                       |
| Tier 1            | Tier 2            | 0.5                     | 0.5                     | 0                       |
| Tier 1            | Tier 3            | 0.25                    | 0.75                    | 0.25                    |
| Tier 2            | Tier 2            | 0                       | 1                       | 0                       |
| Tier 2            | Tier 3            | 0                       | 0.5                     | 0.5                     |
| Tier 3            | Tier 3            | 0                       | 0                       | 1                       |

Once the Weber Box is opened, it will generate a new Weber NFT. The Weber Chest will be consumed in the process. The tier of the new Weber NFT will depend on the tier of the Weber Chest.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Weber Chest Tier</th><th>Weber NFT Tier 1 Prob.</th><th>Weber NFT Tier 3 Prob.</th><th>Weber NFT Tier 2 Prob.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>0.98</td><td>0</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.73</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0.75</td><td>0.25</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Minting Process Recap**

Select two NFTs (Lvl 7+) with the same topic.&#x20;

1. Pay the expected cost based on mint times&#x20;
2. Mint and collect a Weber Chest, whose tier is based on the tiers of the source NFTs.&#x20;
3. Open the Weber Chest to collect a new Weber NFT or sell the Weber Chest in the marketplace.
