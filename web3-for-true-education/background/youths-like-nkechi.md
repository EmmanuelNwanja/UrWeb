# Youths like Nkechi

Nkechi is a young Nigerian girl who had just graduated from a local secondary school. She is smart and ambitious, but she knows that the opportunities available to her are limited. Nkechi has dreams of becoming a software engineer, but she doesn't have many resources at her disposal to make it happen. Although she has a smartphone and access to a computer, she still has to clinically plan her monthly internet subscription because she can't afford to waste it.

One good afternoon, Nkechi stumbled upon a social media post about UrWeb, an EdTech app that provides free access to the best-curated educational resources for various growth pathways in the Web3 space. Intrigued, she decided to check out the platform.

As soon as she logged in with her Web2 Google account, Nkechi was blown away by the quality and structure of resources and training programs respectively on nearly all future of work relevant fields. She spent hours on the platform, devouring knowledge piece by piece as she found them. She was particularly impressed by the interactive and engaging nature of the platform, which allowed learners like her to connect, collaborate, and share ideas with others via an open community.

But what really caught Nkechi's attention was the fact that UrWeb was focused on serving underserved youths like herself. She knew that there were many others like her who were hungry for knowledge but didn't have the luxury of spending internet data trying to find the best knowledge piece on the internet. She also appreciated that the platform was supported by a semi-decentralized autonomous organization (sDAO) community, which operated similarly to the traditional African knowledge-sharing system.

Nkechi became a regular user of UrWeb, and her knowledge and skills began to grow exponentially. She also got to connect with other learners on the platform, forming friendships and collaborations that would last a lifetime.

As her proficiency in software engineering grew, she began to contribute to the UrWeb knowledge base, sharing her own insights, experiences, and new helpful resources with the community. She even became a mentor to some of the newer users on the platform, helping them navigate the world of Web3 and find their own paths to success.

Years later, Nkechi became a successful software engineer, working for one of the top tech companies in Nigeria. But she never forgot the role that UrWeb had played in her journey. She remained an active member of the platform, always eager to give back to the community that had given her so much.

For Nkechi and many others, UrWeb represented more than just a platform for learning. It is a symbol of hope, a beacon of possibility in a world where opportunities are often scarce because they are covered in a pile of less rewarding information. And this is why the UrWeb team is so committed to seeing this vision through â€“ because we know that by empowering underserved youths like Nkechi, we are helping to build a better future for all.
