# Overview

UrWeb aims to build a community-championed digital school where the best available knowledge resource for skill development are sourced by the community, for the community, and made available to all.&#x20;

While platforms like `Web3 University` **** and `BitDegree` already exist, these only duplicated the existing flawed system of centralize-controlled and creator-only dependent resources on the blockchain; oftentimes providing the learning resources themself (platform quality dependent) or approving their preferred content submission (single point of quality assurance) or accepting any and all submissions (quantity > quality).

With UrWeb, anyone can create but the community based on user experience decide what resources are best to rank top and stay on top. Providing easier and cheaper paths to growth for the underserved and everyone else.
