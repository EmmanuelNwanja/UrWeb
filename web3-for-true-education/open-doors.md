# Open Doors

### Beyond SEO & Good Copywriting

We believe that education and schooling should not only be self-paced but interconnected in knowledge and diverse in understanding. Why do we only have many resources of unverified or self-verified knowledge quality when we can have a platform where only the best quality resources are populated based on solid user experience and voting (not just SEO or beautiful copywriting)?

UrWeb is opening the doors to knowledge and education with community and technology to allow verified contributors to curate and update the best resources for every possible skill path of choice.

### Verified Contributors

With community engagement benefits and growth, newbies today will become leaders tomorrow and verified contributors the day after. As contributors, they become the light-bearers of future education as they curate, create, and vote on the best quality resources to feature on UrWeb for the best user experience. Every worker deserves their wage and contributors will get theirs in platform tokens and partner rewards. This will spur a new high for true knowledge and a new financial system will emerge from it `(Ed-Fi Token Economy)`.&#x20;

### Valuable Resources

UrWeb will provide insightful and valuable resources to our community. Using our powerful contributor-content-aggregator process, UrWeb will not only build a high-quality index of articles from traditional media, internet portals, and social networks around the world but also translate . ReadON will also index on-chain content from Mirror and RSS3.

The first phase of ReadON will focus on medium-size articles and blogs, such as analysis reports, tutorials, opinions, and book summaries. Other media formats like full books, novels and videos will be supported in the future based on a paid content integration program.
