# Knowledge Contract

### Comprehensive Design

We believe that knowledge resources should be ranked correctly across platforms for the benefit of all. For example, YouTube videos are designed to work best for creators with the best SEO game or social influence. In this manner, YouTube somewhat disenfranchised the underserved who may not have the resources to scour the platform for the best free content available to answer their specific skill development need, especially in an easy and progressive manner. UrWeb aims to decouple this process by creating a ranking and distribution network with a community-decided standard.

The knowledge contract will house details of topics, pathways, titles, subtitles, and format-standard for today's basic content types. It will be scalable to support videos, discussions, and future media types as well so that users can interact with Web2 content on a Web3 system for their benefit.



### Content Ownership

Intellectual Property Right is a key focus for UrWeb. While a contributor may not be the direct owner of a resource, the contract acknowledges the original source. This enables the best Web2 knowledge resources to be transferred to Web3 in a decentralized manner driven by community and transparency.

UrWeb's solution is to create a simple app (web & mobile) which will enable users to add and update the knowledge base of the growing Web3 community with as simple as a Web2 URL. For proof of ownership and contribution to be easily verified, each contributed Web2 URL is mapped to a Web3 ID for future addition verification. Whether or not, the contributor owns the URL, an ID will be mapped explicitly to each contribution metadata, like a watermark. UrWeb can work with platforms and learning institutions to implement plugins and APIs that would automate the authentication and special purpose use-case. This would enable the best of structured knowledge, Web2 and Web3 to gather in one place and be easily accessible to the underserved.



### Private and Paid Knowledge

Not every piece of information is public, no matter if it is in Web2 or Web3. UrWeb promises to gather and provide the best of free knowledge resources but will also support private and paid resources as much as they are properly validated by our community of verified contributors to support ownership and monetization solutions within the knowledge ecosystem. This will mostly be for advanced resources or skill development where great effort and/or resources have been invested and free resources alone are lacking.
