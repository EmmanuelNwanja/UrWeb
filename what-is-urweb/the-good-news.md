UrWeb is a dApp that offers underserved youths and Web3 enthusiasts a community to connect, collaborate, share and build on ideas, and grow. The platform provides a constantly-evolving library of resources and programs on Web3-relevant skills, designed to be interactive and engaging. The dApp is supported by a semi-decentralized autonomous organization (sDAO) community, which allows community-verified contributors to add to the knowledge base of the app.
