# UrWeb's Mission

Our mission can be broken down into three components, each of which builds upon the other to sustain the UrWeb experience (`Webing`).

### Open Doors

First, UrWeb proposes to build a Web3-focused but Web2-interfacing app that catalyzes the onboarding and education of Web2-groomed youths to acquire Web3-relevant skills, (both tech and non-tech) and contribute to the ecosystem for social-economic advancements.

### Knowledge Contract

Next, UrWeb proposes to build a public contract dedicated to learning resources, both on-chain and off-chain, so that all relevant resources, including existing public Web2 content, can be indexed, curated, rendered, and most importantly, assigned to its real owner.

### Ed-Fi Token Economy

Then, we will build a knowledge ecosystem, complete with flexible incentive and governance systems, so that institutions, tutors, curators, and learners can all participate in a decentralized education process. And help cater to true fees and scholarship financing.

### Decentralized Assessment System

To crown it all, UrWeb will combine AI and blockchain technology to build a skill assessment system that enables institutions and tutors to better assess their wards with recommended the best paths for progress.
